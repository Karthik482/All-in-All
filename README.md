The goal of the projects was to build a scalable database using different platforms like MySQL and NoSQL. Using this data, analysts can find different patterns which will help AllinAll(retail store name) to strategically plan before expanding their business to other locations. We used R to further analyze the data using R GGplot by connecting the Mysql database to R.
